# gMKVExtractGUI Flatpak

ðŸ“¦ Flatpak Package of gMKVExtractGUI for Linux

gMKVExtractGUI is a small GUI utility to use mkvinfo and mkvextract cli tools from MKVToolnix pack, in order to extract tracks, chapters and CUE sheets from mkv files.  
It runs on Linux using Mono. The "source" (build v2.5.2 from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmkvextractgui/files/)) is included here as a .tar.xz file because flatpak can't use .7z files.

## Installing

I'm hosting this Flatpak on my own Flatpak Repo. You can install it from there like this:

```bash
flatpak install https://flatpak.nils.moe/net.sourceforge.gMKVExtractGUI.flatpakref
```

You can also install it from the bundle in Releases on GitHub, but you won't get updates that way.
